# Getting started

## Encryption

### for the attacker:
1. The first thing you have to do is generate a key pair for the attackers decryption/encryption

you can generate a key pair using the attacker module /attacker/attacker_modules/generate_attacker_keys.py

    python generate_attacker_keys.py

this will generate 2 keys in the attacker_modules folder.

2. Now you have to move the 2 keys out of the attacker_modules folder and to the parent directory /attacker

you can do this with the following command:

    mv private_attacker.pem ..
    mv public_attacker.pem ..

### for the victim:
1. For the victim you have to make sure it has the 'public_attacker.pem' key in its folder aswell next to the main

Make sure this is the same attacker public key as the one you generated before


## Running the code

### folder structure:
before running the code your folder structure should look like this:

    |-/attacker/
        |- attacker_modules.py
        |- main_attacker_framework.py
        |- public_attacker.pem
        |- private_attacker.pem
    |-/victim/
        |- victim_modules
        |- main.py
        |- public_attacker.pem
##

##Functionality













Wip:
- add automatic public key sending from the attacker to the victim
- add the browser password decryption module
